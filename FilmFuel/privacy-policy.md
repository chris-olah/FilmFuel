FilmFuel – Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 2025

FilmFuel (“the App”) is developed and maintained by Chris Olah (“we,” “us,” or “our”).
We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your rights.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

FilmFuel does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.

Specifically, the App does not:

collect your name, email, or contact information

track your location

store personal identifiers

use third-party analytics

share data with advertisers

integrate any tracking SDKs

We do not operate a server backend, and no personal data is sent outside your device.

2. Information Stored on Your Device

FilmFuel stores a small amount of local-only app data, such as:

saved favorite quotes

streak progress

app settings (notifications, preferences)

downloaded metadata required for app functionality

This data:

stays entirely on your device

is never transmitted to us or any third party

can be deleted at any time by uninstalling the App

3. In-App Purchases

If you choose to make a tip/support purchase, the App uses Apple’s In-App Purchase system (StoreKit).

We do not receive or store:

your payment information

your Apple ID

your billing address

All purchase processing is handled securely by Apple, and governed by Apple’s privacy and security policies.

4. Third-Party Content

The App may provide outbound links to external websites (such as IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes) for convenience.

These links:

open externally

do not track you within the App

are governed by the privacy policies of those third-party websites

FilmFuel does not embed or display third-party tracking content.

5. Children’s Privacy

FilmFuel does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13.
The App is designed for general audiences and does not contain inappropriate content.

6. Data Security

Because FilmFuel does not collect or store personal data, there is no personal information at risk. Local-only data stored on your device remains protected by your device’s operating system.

7. Your Choices

You may:

delete all local data by uninstalling the App

disable notifications at any time in iOS Settings

No additional privacy-related actions are required because no personal data is collected.

8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App.
Updates will be posted with a new “Last Updated” date.
